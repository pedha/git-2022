--> Regression Model
    It is a type of supervised learning
    Connection or relation between two things is called as regression
    Two terms we should be aware of Correlation and Regression quantifiers
    We cant have perfectly linear relationship - iska solution hai regression
    The problem statement can be solved using least squares

--> Classification Model
    It is used when we want to get a answer in yes/no, true/false ir similar types
    K-means algorithm - It finds the similar kinds of items and groups them into a clusters 
    Algorithm to find the distacne between points
        - Euclidean distance measure
        - Manhattan distacne measure
        - A squared euclidean distacne measure
        - Cosine distacne measure 
    To terms are important entropy and information gain.
