MOORE'S LAW AND PARALLEL PROCESSING :-
	-- Moore's law is a term used to refer to the observation made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law isn't really a law in the legal sense or even a proven theory in the scientific sense (such as E = mc2).
	-- Parallel processing is a method in computing of running two or more processors (CPUs) to handle separate parts of an overall task. Breaking up different parts of a task among multiple processors will help reduce the amount of time to run a program.
	
BIG DATA :-
	-- This is a term related to extracting meaningful data by analyzing the huge amount of complex, variously formatted data generated at high speed, that cannot be handled, or processed by the traditional system. 

What is the difference between scale up and scale down?

HDFS :-
	-- Data Storage in HDFS

HADOOP FILE SYSTEMS (FS) COMMANDS :-
	-- create a directory
	-- list the content of a directory
	-- upload a file in HDFS
	-- download a file from HDFS
	-- view the contents of a file

MAPREDUCE :-
	-- SORT and SHUFFLE

APACHE SPARKS :-
	-- SparkContext Object
	-- Spark initialization - version before and from 2.0

pySpark Basics :-
	-- Fundamental Data Abstractions in pySpark
		-- RDD(Resilient Distributed Dataset) - Low Level Data Structure >> a set of elements of the same data type 
		-- DataFrame - High Level Data Structure >> a table of rows with named columns
		-- Dataset* >> similar to relational tables and not supported in pyspark , supported in java
	-- Data Processing in pySpark
