-> LPWAN :- LOW POWER WIDE AREA NETWORK
	-- LoRaWAN
	-- SigFox
	-- NB-IOT

-> LoRaWAN :- 
	-- Low speed but long range and low power
	-- Ideal for sensors that only seldomly send a value
	-- LoRa is a modulation technique in physical layer
	-- LoRaWAN specturm is unlicensed
	-- single LoRa gateway potentially cover a significant amount of area

	-> LoRaWAN Physical layer :-
		-- Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)

	-> LoRaWAN Mac Layer :-
		-- Class-A is the best for energy mitigation while having the highest latency >> most energy efficient devices
		-- Class-B is between Class-A and Class-C
		-- Class-C has minimum latency but the highest energy usage >> lowest energy
	
-> SigFox :-
	-- Low speed but low power, but also long range
	-- meant for remote meter reading also used for any remote data uplink
	-- security >> no encryption
	-- cost >> cheap client equipment

-> NB-IOT :-
	-- Low power wide area network
	-- also known as CAT-M2 / CAT-NB
	-- For NB-IOT in LTE there are 2 band :- 	>> In-band option
							>> Gaurd-band option
	-- CAT-NB is a licensed spectrum
	-- IIOT :- INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS
	-- CIOT :- CELLULAR INTERNET OF THINGS
	
-> Other Wireless Protocols :-
	-- LTE Cat-M :-
		-- Use cellular channels for long range
		-- limited bandwidth
		-- communication
	-- Satellite :-
		-- huge coverage
		-- extremely expensive
