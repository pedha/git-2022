IrDA :-
	-- INFRARED DATA ASSOCIATION
	-- has its own protocol stack
	-- Characteristics of IR
		-- it is more secure than radio frequency communication
		-- avoid many kinds of interference that affect radio frequency signals
	-- It is most commonly used infrared connection
	-- its only one to one communication
	-- inexpensive technology >> low cost components
	-- There are three versions >>
		IrDA Version						Speed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Serial Infrared (SIR)					9600-115200 bps
	Fast Infrared (FIR)					4 mbps
	Very Fast Infrared (VFIR)				16 mbps
	
	-- Multiple Infrared Connections
	-- Simplified IrDA protocol Stack
		lowest layer >> IR physical link (IrPHY)
	-- Functions of the Layers
	
RFID :-
	-- RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION
	-- There are 3 general varieties of RFID :-
		>> passive
		>> semi-passive
		>> active
	-- Classes of RFID
		>> class 0 / class I
		>> class II
		>> class III
		>> class IV
		>> class V
	-- RFID operating frequency
	
GPS :-
	-- GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
	-- GPS system components
		-- space segment
	-- GPS system architecture
		-- Distance = Velocity * Time
	-- GPS positioning technology
		-- triangulation method
	-- NAVIC system
		-- GEO
		-- GSO
	-- LBS >> LOCATION BASED SERVICE
	-- AGPS >> ASSISTED GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
	-- WIDE AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM
