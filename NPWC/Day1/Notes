Network model for IOT needs:

--> NBIOT - Narrow Band IoT
	LTEMIOT - Long Term Evaluation for Machines IoT

--> NFC - 10cm
	Bluetooth - 10m
	 
--> Networks available
	WPAN, 6LowPAN, WPAN ZigBee, WLAN Wi-Fi, WPAN Bluetooth
	
--> 6LowPAN - IPv6 Low Power Personal Area Network

--> Bluetooth classic 2.0
	Bluetooth LowerPower

--> IEEE 802.15.4 is used in the MAC/Data layer and Physical layer
	ZigBee is on Network layer and Application layer
	
--> OSI - PDNTSPA
	TCP/IP - ATIN

--> ZigBee has Coordinator (C), Router (R) and End Device (E)
	It is based on 802.15.4 protocol
	Defines the Physical and MAC layer
	
--> CConverting from IPv6 to IPv4 is done via border router

--> Delta time is the time taken between two packets to arrive
