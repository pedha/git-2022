He is often bullied by Takeshi Goda (nicknamed Gian), an irascible and strong-willed bully, and Suneo Honekawa (Gian's sidekick), a wealthy and spoiled boy who uses his friendship with Gian to win the respect of other schoolmates. Nobita's only dream of marrying Shizuka Minamoto, his friend and fellow classmate, is hindered by the presence of Hidetoshi Dekisugi, an intelligent student who exerts a strong attraction on her. </p>
